# SOC-Based SPC Drug Management System

This is an academic project developed as part of my Higher National Diploma (HND) in Software Engineering.
The system is designed based on a Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) architecture to manage drug distribution
processes of the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC).

## Project Overview

The SPC Drug Management System helps manage and monitor drug orders, suppliers, pharmacies, warehouses,
and manufacturing plants using web services. Each stakeholder interacts with the system through
role-based dashboards.

This project focuses on understanding SOC concepts, web services, and system integration.
